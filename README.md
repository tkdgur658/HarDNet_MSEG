# Implementation of HarDNet-MSEG using PyTorch Deep Learning Framework
 
The architecture was inspired by Hardnet-mseg: A simple encoder-decoder polyp segmentation neural network that achieves over 0.9 mean dice and 86 fps. 

## Overview
This repository contains an unofficial implementation of HarDNet-MSEG using PyTorch.<br/>
